Write a function called delete_starting_evens() that has a parameter named my_list.

The function should remove elements from the front of my_list until the front of the list is not even. The function should then return my_list.

For example if my_list started as [4, 8, 10, 11, 12, 15], then delete_starting_evens(my_list) should return [11, 12, 15].

Make sure your function works even if every element in the list is even!
