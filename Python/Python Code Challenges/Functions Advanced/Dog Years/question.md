Some say that every one year of a human’s life is equivalent to seven years of a dog’s life. Write a function named dog_years() that has two parameters named name and age.

The function should compute the age in dog years and return the following string:

"{name}, you are {age} years old in dog years"

Test this function with your name and your age!
