In the DriveBot class, add a method called control_bot which accepts parameters: new_speed and new_direction. These should replace the associated instance variables. Create another method called adjust_sensor which accepts a parameter called new_sensor_range which replaces the sensor_range instance variable. Afterwards, use these methods to rotate the robot 180 degrees at 10 miles per hour with a sensor range of 20 feet. Use the provided print statements to check your code!
