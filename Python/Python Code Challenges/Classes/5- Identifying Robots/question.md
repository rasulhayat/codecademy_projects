Within the DriveBot class, create an instance variable called id which will be assigned to the robot when the object is created. Every time a robot is created, increment a counter (stored as a class variable) so that the next robot will have a different id. For example, if three robots were created: first_robot, next_robot, and last_robot; first_robot will have an id of 1 next_robot will have an id of 2 and last_robot will have an id of 3.
