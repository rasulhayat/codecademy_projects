Create a class variable called all_disabled which is set to False. Next, create two more class variables called latitude and longitude. Set both of those variables to equal -999999. A third robot has been created below the first two robots. Set the latitude of all of the robots to -50.0 at once. Additionally, set the longitude of the robots to 50.0 and set all_disabled to True. You should be able to set those values using three lines of code.
