Upgrade the constructor in the DriveBot class in order to accept three optional parameters. The constructor can accept motor_speed (which defaults to 0 if not provided), direction (which defaults to 180 if not provided, and sensor_range (which defaults to 10 if not provided). These parameters should replace the associated instance variables. Test out the upgraded constructor by initializing a new robot called robot_2 with a speed of 35, a direction of 75, and a sensor range of 25.
