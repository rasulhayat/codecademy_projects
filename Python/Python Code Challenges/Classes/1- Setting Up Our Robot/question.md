Create a python class called DriveBot. Within this class, create instance variables for motor_speed, sensor_range, and direction. All of these should be initialized to 0 by default. After setting up the class, create an object from the class called robot_1. Set the motor_speed to 5, the direction to 90, and the sensor_range to 10. Use the provided print statements to check your work!
